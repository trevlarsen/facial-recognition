# Facial Recognition

This project implements the Eigenfaces method for facial recognition, a technique rooted in principal component analysis (PCA). The process involves subtracting the "mean face" from each face in the database, centering the data, and projecting it onto a lower-dimensional subspace. This approach highlights key facial features while significantly reducing computational complexity through a low-rank approximation of the dataset.
